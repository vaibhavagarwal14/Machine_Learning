# Machine_Learning

This repository contains the implementation and exercises of the ML algorithms that has been learned by me.  

The Algorithms and concepts that have been implemented so far are :  

-> Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis  
-> Linear Regression  
-> Ridge Regression  
-> Lasso Regression  
-> Multiple Linear Regression  
-> Multicollinearity Linear Regression  
-> Gradient Descent  
-> Hypothesis Testing - T Test, Chi Square Test  
-> Multiclass Performance Metrics  
-> One Hot Encoding  

Kindly ping me up for suggestions, feedback, comments and/or queries.  

Contributions to the Repo are welcome.
